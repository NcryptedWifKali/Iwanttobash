# README document

A tool for bash scripting with options for python html etc.
	
	ICode will remind a user how to start a bash script from a,
	terminal and attempt to automate that process.

current bugs: 
	I'm aware of a few such as once I select the filename and I'm 
	prompted to make a selection. And I chose option, 1 Start a new Bash Script. 
	The #!/bin/bash is not appended, the file does contain the extenstion.
	bash.

Issue also with option 3, Run Bash Program. I get the error: Couldn't get a 
file descriptor referring to thw console. 

option 6 and 7 I have not added anything to they open nano text editor.

future uses:
	I would like to have a auto bash make side that could create 
	anywhere from 1-10 - or even 100 randomly created scripts.
	
	Then have them test run in a virtual shell,
	omit result's on the test screen with a tally of sucess.
	or to have it use shell templates to only need to slightly edit 
	or test with other scripts.
 	
	I would like to also add certain code statement such as , if for while 
	auto statements to speed up testing and writing.








My program, that needs more work on

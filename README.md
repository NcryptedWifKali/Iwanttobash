# README document

A tool for bash scripting with options for python html etc.
	
	ICode will remind a user how to start a bash script from a,
	terminal and attempt to automate that process.

current bugs: 
	I'm aware of a few such as once I select the filename and I'm 
	prompted to make a selection. And I chose option, 1 Start a new Bash Script. 
	The #!/bin/bash is not appended, the file does contain the extenstion.
	bash.

Issue also with option 3, Run Bash Program. I get the error: Couldn't get a 
file descriptor referring to thw console. 

option 6 and 7 I have not added anything to they open nano text editor.

future uses:
	I would like to have a auto maker side that can create 1 10 - 100 
	scripts and test them in a virtual shell, result the test sucess
 	
	I would like to also add certain code statement such as , if for while 
	auto statements to speed up testing and writing.

  	Also to have the Menu 1-9 extend into a sub menu 1-9

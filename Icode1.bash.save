# Things I would like to add to the program would be a auto statment maker 
# and auto create bash programs like open the randomly grep for certain 
# keywords, and random cut from a libary of scripts 10 - 100 scripts
# run it in a virtual terminal, looking for errors and print out example
# 3 out of 100  run with no errors, would you like to view these?
# 17 out of 100 return a slight error, would you like to inspec these.
# 83% percent should be removed. something like that just visualising it out

# My first bash application would like any help, still trying to learn how 
# github works
